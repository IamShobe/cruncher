Logical expressions are used in QQL to combine and evaluate boolean conditions, typically in commands like `where` and `eval`. They support logical operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, as well as grouping with parentheses.

## Description

A logical expression allows you to combine multiple boolean conditions using logical operators. This enables you to build complex filters and computed fields based on your data.

Supported logical operators:
- `&&` (AND): Both conditions must be true.
- `||` (OR): At least one condition must be true.
- `!` (NOT): Negates a condition.
- Parentheses `()` can be used to group expressions and control precedence.
- Compare operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` can be used within logical expressions.

Logical expressions can be nested and combined with comparison operators and functions.

## Syntax

```
where logical_expression
```

A logical expression can be:
- A comparison: `field == value`
- A function: `isNull(field)`
- A combination: `(field1 == "foo" && field2 > 10) || isNull(field3)`

## Usage Examples

**Simple AND:**
```
where status == "error" && duration > 1000
```

**Simple OR:**
```
where status == "error" || status == "warn"
```

**Negation:**
```
where !(level == "info")
```

**Grouping:**
```
where (status == "error" || status == "warn") && duration > 1000
```

**With functions:**
```
where isNull(optional_field) || contains(message, "timeout")
```

Logical expressions are parsed and evaluated according to standard boolean logic, with parentheses controlling precedence.
