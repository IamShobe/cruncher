<Badge text="table" />

The `table` command displays the results of the pipeline as a table, allowing you to select and order specific fields.

## Syntax

```
table field1, field2, ...
```

- `field1, field2, ...`: The fields to display as columns in the output table, in the specified order.

## Usage

- Use `table` at the end of a pipeline to control which fields are shown and their order.
- If not specified, all fields may be shown in default order.

## Example

```
... | table timestamp, message, level
```

This displays the `timestamp`, `message`, and `level` fields as columns in the output table.
