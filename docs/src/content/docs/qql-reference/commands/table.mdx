<Badge text="table" />

The `table` command displays the results of the pipeline as a table, allowing you to select and order specific fields. You can also use the `as` keyword to assign an alias to any column.

## Syntax

```
table field1 [as alias1], field2 [as alias2], ...
```

- `field [as alias]`: The field to display as a column, optionally renamed with `as`.

## Usage

- Use `table` at the end of a pipeline to control which fields are shown and their order.
- Use `as` to rename columns for clarity or convenience.
- If not specified, all fields may be shown in default order.

## Example

```
... | table timestamp as time, message, level as severity
```

This displays the `timestamp` field as `time`, the `message` field, and the `level` field as `severity` in the output table.
