The `stats` command performs aggregations (such as count, sum, avg, min, max) over your data, optionally grouped by one or more fields.

## Syntax

```
stats [agg1(field1) as alias1, ...] [by groupField1, groupField2, ...]
```

- `agg(field) as alias`: Aggregation function (e.g., `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`) applied to a field, optionally renamed with `as`.
- `by groupField1, ...`: (Optional) Group results by one or more fields.

## Usage

- Use `stats` to summarize data, such as counting events or calculating averages.
- Multiple aggregations and groupings are supported.

## Example

```
stats count() as total, avg(duration) as avg_duration by user
```

This counts all records and calculates the average `duration` for each `user`.
