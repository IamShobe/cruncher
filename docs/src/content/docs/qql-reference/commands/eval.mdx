The `eval` command creates or modifies fields by evaluating expressions for each record.

## Syntax

```
eval newField = expression
```

- `newField = expression`: Assigns the result of the expression to a new or existing field.

## Usage

- Use `eval` to compute new values, transform fields, or perform calculations.

## Example

```
eval duration_sec = duration / 1000
```

This creates a `duration_sec` field.
