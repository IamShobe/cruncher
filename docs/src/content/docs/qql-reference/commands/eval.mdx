title: eval
description: The eval command in QQL allows you to create or modify fields by evaluating expressions for each record.
---

The `eval` command creates or modifies fields by evaluating expressions for each record.

## Syntax

```
eval newField = expression
```

- `newField = expression`: Assigns the result of the expression to a new or existing field.

## Supported Functions and Expressions

You can use arithmetic, logical, and conditional expressions, as well as functions, in `eval` assignments. Common supported functions include:

- Mathematical: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- String: `lower(str)`, `upper(str)`, `length(str)`
- Number: `abs(x)`, `round(x)`, `ceil(x)`, `floor(x)`
- Boolean: `contains(str, substr)`, `startsWith(str, prefix)`, `endsWith(str, suffix)`, `match(str, regex)`, `isNull(x)`, `isNotNull(x)`
- Conditional: `if(condition, then, else)`, `case((cond1, val1), ..., elseVal)`

> Only functions supported by your Cruncher deployment are available. See the main documentation for a full list.

## Usage

- Use `eval` to compute new values, transform fields, or perform calculations.
- You can assign multiple fields by chaining multiple `eval` commands in your pipeline.
- Use conditional logic to create new fields based on complex criteria.

## Examples

```
eval duration_sec = duration / 1000
```
This creates a `duration_sec` field.

```
eval is_error = (status == "error")
```
This creates a boolean field `is_error` that is true if `status` is `error`.

```
eval user_lower = lower(user)
```
This creates a new field `user_lower` with the lowercase value of `user`.

```
eval error_type = if(status == "error", "critical", "normal")
```
This creates a new field `error_type` based on the value of `status`.

```
eval match_found = match(message, "^Error:.*")
```
This creates a boolean field `match_found` that is true if `message` matches the regex pattern.

```
eval group = case(status == "error", "A", status == "warn", "B", "C")
```
This creates a new field `group` with value "A" if `status` is `error`, "B" if `status` is `warn`, and "C" otherwise.
