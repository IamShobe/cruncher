The `regex` command extracts values from a field using a regular expression and creates new fields from the captured groups.

## Syntax

```
regex [field="<FIELD_NAME>"] `<PATTERN>`
```

- `FIELD_NAME`: The field to apply the regex to. If not specified, defaults to `_raw`.
- `PATTERN`: The regular expression pattern, using named capture groups.

## Usage

- Use `regex` to parse and extract structured data from text fields.
- Named capture groups become new fields in the output.

## Example

```
regex field="message" `(?<user>\\w+) logged in from (?<ip>\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)`
```

This extracts `user` and `ip` from the `message` field.
