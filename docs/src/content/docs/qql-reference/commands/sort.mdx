The `sort` command orders records by one or more fields, in ascending or descending order.

## Syntax

```
sort FIELD_NAME [asc|desc], ...
```

- `FIELD_NAME`: The fields to sort by.
- `asc`: Sort in ascending order (default).
- `desc`: Sort in descending order.

## Usage

- Use `sort` to control the order of results in the output table or view.
- Multiple fields can be specified for multi-level sorting.

## Example

```
sort -timestamp, user
```

This sorts results by `timestamp` descending, then by `user` ascending`.
