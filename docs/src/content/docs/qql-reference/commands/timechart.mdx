The `timechart` command creates a time series visualization by aggregating data into time buckets. It supports multiple aggregation functions, grouping, and several parameters for customizing the time axis and grouping behavior.

## Syntax

```
timechart [span=interval] [timeCol=field] [maxGroups=N] [agg(field) [as alias], ...] [by groupField1, ...]
```

- `span=interval`: (Optional) Bucket size for the time axis (e.g., `1m`, `5m`, `1h`).
- `timeCol=field`: (Optional) The field to use as the time axis (default is usually `timestamp`).
- `maxGroups=N`: (Optional) Maximum number of groups to display (limits cardinality).
- `agg(field) [as alias]`: Aggregation function (e.g., `count()`, `sum(field)`, `avg(field)`) optionally renamed with `as`.
- `by groupField1, ...`: (Optional) Group results by one or more fields.

## Usage

- Use `timechart` to visualize trends over time, with flexible grouping and aggregation.
- Supports multiple aggregations, grouping, and time axis customization.
- All parameters are optional except for at least one aggregation.

## Example

```
timechart span=5m timeCol=event_time maxGroups=10 count() as total, avg(duration) as avg_duration by status 
```

This creates a time series of event counts and average duration per `status` in 5-minute intervals, using `event_time` as the time axis, and limits to 10 groups.
