title: unpack
description: Extracts and flattens fields from nested objects or JSON strings in a column, creating new columns for each key.
---

The `unpack` command extracts and flattens fields from nested objects or JSON strings in the specified columns. For each key in the object or parsed JSON, a new column is created with the name `<column>.<key>`. This is useful for working with logs or data where fields are embedded as JSON or objects inside a single column.

## Syntax

```
unpack <column1>[, <column2>, ...]
```

- `<column>`: The name of the column to unpack. You can specify multiple columns, separated by commas.

## Usage

- Use `unpack` to flatten nested objects or JSON strings in your data, making each key accessible as its own column.
- If the column contains a JSON string, it will be parsed and its keys unpacked.
- If the column is already an object, its keys will be unpacked directly.
- If the column is not an object or a valid JSON string, an error will be logged and the row will be skipped for that column.

## Examples

Unpack a JSON string in the `payload` column:

```
... | unpack payload
```

If `payload` contains:

```json
{"user":"alice","ip":"1.2.3.4"}
```

The result will have new columns: `payload.user` and `payload.ip`.

Unpack multiple columns:

```
... | unpack payload, details
```

If `details` contains:

```json
{"os":"linux","version":"1.0"}
```

The result will have: `payload.user`, `payload.ip`, `details.os`, `details.version`.

Unpack an object column:

```
... | unpack metadata
```

If `metadata` is already an object like:

```json
{"env":"prod","region":"us-east"}
```

The result will have: `metadata.env`, `metadata.region`.
