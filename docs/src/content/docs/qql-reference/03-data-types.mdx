Cruncher QQL allows you to manipulate and analyze fields that are extracted by the underlying data adapters. Each field is assigned a type by the adapter, which can be one of the following:

- **NumberField**: Numeric values (integers or floats)
- **StringField**: Text values
- **DateField**: Dates as numeric timestamps (milliseconds since epoch)
- **BooleanField**: True/false values
- **ArrayField**: Arrays of fields (can be mixed types)
- **ObjectField**: Objects with named fields
- **NullField**: Represents a missing or undefined value

When you query data, the adapter extracts fields and assigns them types. Cruncher then allows you to manipulate, transform, and analyze these fields using QQL commands.

If a value is missing or cannot be typed, it is treated as `null` or `undefined`.

## Example: Using Field Types in Queries

When you use QQL commands, fields are already typed by the adapter. For example:

```
eval duration_sec = duration / 1000
```

If `duration` is a number, `duration_sec` will also be a number field. If a field is missing, it will be `null` or `undefined`.

Understanding field types helps you write more precise queries and interpret your results with confidence.
