description: How to use Cruncher with various data sources and adapters.
---

Cruncher supports a flexible adapter system, allowing you to connect to and query data from a variety of sources. Adapters are responsible for connecting to external systems, extracting fields, and providing data to Cruncher in a unified format.

## What is an Adapter?

An adapter is a module that knows how to communicate with a specific backend or data source (such as Grafana Loki, Docker logs, or mocked/test data). It extracts fields from the source data and exposes them to Cruncher for querying and analysis.

## Built-in Adapters

Cruncher comes with several built-in adapters, including:

- **Grafana Browser Adapter**: Connects to Grafana Loki via the browser, allowing you to query logs and metrics from your Grafana instance.
- **Docker Adapter**: Reads logs from Docker containers.
- **Mocked Data Adapter**: Provides sample/mock data for testing and demos.

## Configuring Adapters

Adapters are configured in the Cruncher config file (`~/.config/cruncher/cruncher.config.yaml`). Each adapter entry specifies the type, name, and any required parameters. For example:

```yaml
connectors:
  - type: grafana_browser
    name: main
    params:
      grafanaUrl: <your_grafana_url>
      uid: <your_loki_uid>
      # ...other params...
  - type: docker
    name: docker_logs
    # ...params...
```

See the [installation guide](/getting-started/02-installation) and [configuration reference](/getting-started/05-config-file) for more details.

## How Adapters Work

- Adapters extract fields and assign types to each field.
- Controller parameters in your QQL queries are passed directly to the adapter, allowing for efficient server-side filtering.
- Once data is loaded, you can use all of Cruncher's QQL features to analyze and transform it.

## Writing Your Own Adapter

Cruncher is designed to be extensible. You can implement your own adapter by following the patterns in the `src/adapters/` directory. Adapters must expose a controller and implement the required interface for data extraction and field typing.

Adapters make Cruncher a powerful tool for querying and analyzing data from many different sources, all with a consistent query experience.
