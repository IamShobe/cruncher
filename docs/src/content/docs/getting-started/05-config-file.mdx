Cruncher uses a YAML configuration file to define which adapters and data sources are available. This file tells Cruncher how to connect to your data and what options to use for each adapter.

## Location

The config file should be placed at:

```
~/.config/cruncher/cruncher.config.yaml
```

## Basic Structure

A typical config file looks like this:

```yaml
# Cruncher configuration file
profiles:
    default:
        connectors: [main]
    docker:
        connectors: [docker_logs]
    all:
        connectors: [main, docker_logs]
connectors:
  - type: grafana_browser
    name: main
    params:
      grafanaUrl: <your_grafana_url>
      uid: <your_loki_uid>
      filter:
        - key: label1
          value: "label1_value"
          operator: "="
      querySuffix: []
  - type: docker
    name: docker_logs
    # ...params for docker adapter...
```

- `connectors`: A list of adapters to use. Each entry defines an adapter type, a name, and any required parameters.
- `type`: The adapter type (e.g., `grafana_browser`, `docker`, `mocked_data`).
- `name`: A unique name for this adapter instance.
- `params`: Adapter-specific parameters (see adapter docs for details).

## Profiles

Cruncher supports the concept of profiles, allowing you to define multiple sets of connectors and settings in the same config file. Each profile can represent a different environment, use case, or set of data sources.

- The `default` profile is used automatically when starting Cruncher.
- You can switch profiles to quickly inside the Cruncher platform.

<Aside type="tip">
- Use profiles to easily switch between production, development, or test data sources without editing your main config file each time.
- You can define multiple connectors in the same config file.
- Each adapter may require different parametersâ€”see the adapter documentation for details.
- After editing the config file, restart Cruncher to apply changes.
