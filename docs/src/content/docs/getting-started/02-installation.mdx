### Download and Install

<Steps>
1. Go to the [Cruncher releases page](https://github.com/IamShobe/cruncher/releases/latest).
2. Download the latest `.zip` file for macOS.
3. Extract the zip file.
4. Move the `cruncher.app` to your `Applications` folder.
5. Double-click to run Cruncher.
</Steps>

#### If you see a corruption warning:
Open your terminal and run:
```zsh
xattr -cr /Applications/cruncher.app
```
This will clear the quarantine attribute and allow you to open the app.  
It's required because Cruncher is not codesigned yet.
